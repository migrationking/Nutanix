Apache Web Server Administration
The Apache web server has a standard install and maintenance cycle using:

sudo yum install -y httpd
sudo systemctl {enable,start,status,stop,restart} httpd
Firewall and security group access details:

http is TCP port 80
https is TCP port 443 (outside of the scope of our course)
Configuration files are under the /etc/httpd/ directory and the web document root where programs and web pages reside in the /var/www/html/ directory.

Troubleshooting logs:

sudo journalctl -u httpd
tail /etc/httpd/logs/\*.log

*Configuration Files for web server /etc/httpd

HAProxy uses the standard install and maintenance cycle:

sudo yum install -y haproxy
sudo systemctl {enable,start,status,stop,restart} haproxy
We are using HAProxy to direct traffic to web servers, so the Firewall and security group access is for http on TCP port 80.

The HAProxy configuration file is /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg

For troubleshooting logs:

sudo journalctl -u haproxy
